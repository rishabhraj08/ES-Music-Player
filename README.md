This is a basic music app,with firebase authentication.. The android studio version required to work on this app is 3.0 or more. pull requests will be entertained. it would be great if someone works on the song search bar and improved the ui or basic functions. at first whenanybody tries to open the app it will crash and then you have to go to app info of that app and select required permissions it is because due to android versions above 6 one has to give all the permissions at run time not manually..
